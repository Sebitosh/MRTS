# Installing MRTS

MRTS needs Python3, tested with 3.9.

If you only want to build rule set, the basic Python3 is enough. If you want to check the covered variables, you need to install [msc_pyparser](https://github.com/digitalwave/msc_pyparser), which avaliable also throug [Pypi](https://pypi.org/project/msc-pyparser/).
